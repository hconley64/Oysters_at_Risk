      <div class="text">The ocean absorbs about 33% of the carbon dioxide humans emit through the combustion of fossil fuels, which would otherwise accelerate global warming. But when that carbon dioxide enters the water, it changes the chemistry, increasing the dissolved carbon in the system making it more acidic. </div>

      <div class="text"> Humans have overharvested oysters for far too long. Roughly 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have disappeared since the late 1800s. Fishermen using destructive dredging practices, harvesting entire reefs, excessive pollution and the introduction of non-native species have caused many reefs to become, “Functionally extinct.” About 75% of the worlds remaining reefs are in North America, with only the ones in the Gulf of Mexico considered healthy.</div>

      <div class="text"> Oysters form their shells through calcification. precipitating crystals out of the water using the mantle tissue under their shells. If the water they’re in is below a threshold of acidity it dissolves their shells. Research by Dr. Emily B. Rivest has shown that some waters in the Chesapeake Bay will have 4 hours a day below the threshold and others 20. During those hours the oysters are losing more shell than they can create, meaning they’re thin and brittle, not dissimilar from the bones of humans with Osteoporosis. </div>

      <div class="icon">
      <img src="Images/6_seafood.png" alt="seafoodd icon"></div>
      <div class="text"> Many fish species rely on oyster reefs. They form a three-dimensional structure where their shells form nooks and crannies that serve as homes for a variety of fish species including blue crab, shrimp, anchovies and striped bass. When those fish are young, they rely on oyster reefs for food and protection from predators. Oyster reefs have been over harvested, meaning less space for the species who rely on reefs. It also means fewer oysters in the future because young oysters root onto older shells. With fewer shells to attach to, there’s only so much room for new oysters. </div>

      <h4> How Changing Oysters Will Impact Humans </h4>

      <div class="text"> Shellfish harvests are expected to decrease by 25% in the next 50 years, which could drive farmers from the industry. Oyster farming is one of the most sustainable forms of agriculture. Not only does it not require inputs, but oysters improve water quality by filtering and lowering the acidity of their local system.  For farmers who rely on oysters their crop is much less stable than it once was, with huge crops being lost at the vulnerable larval stage. The causes of these major failures are not yet fully understood, but Virginia Institute of Marine Science has ongoing studies to determine what’s causing the failures and how its impacting oyster farmer behavior. </div>

      <div class="icon">

      <div class="text">These compounding factors will all have major impacts at the dinner table. Thinning shells, caused by acidification, will mean shells will be more likely to shatter when being shucked. This could make half shell plates a thing of the past.  All the species that rely on oyster reefs might have decreased populations, meaning prices will increase. Restaurants can help with this by collecting shells to be returned to reefs for young oysters to root to. This, however, won’t help with the issues caused by acidification. Without drastically decreasing carbon output, and increasing restoration of oyster reefs, the availability of many fish, crustacean and bivalve species will be greatly decreased. </div>
